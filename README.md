# mnist_practice
First (mostly) self written code to analyse MNIST dataset using tensorflow

I say mostly because the structure and the commands are often similar to the ones provided by professor Andrew Ng's coursera course about tensorflow, though a good portion was written by myself

#The py file is just a copy paste of the jupyter notebook file

Hi, I am William and this is my first GitHub post, where I use the MNIST dataset and create a small neural network to identify hand written numbers 


- Tensorflow is the primary framework (imported keras though didn't use it
- I did not apply a convolutional neural network
- Dev / Test set verification is not (yet) implemented


Could be better, but:


Cost after 200 iteraions is: 6.864248

Train Accuracy: 0.82778573
